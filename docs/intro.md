## Introduction
This is a console banking application created to help monitor the cash flow of bank accounts for Digital Futures Bank. The application will output in the terminal funds that were deposited or credited into an account. Users will be able to deposit funds or withdraw money if they have a sufficient balance to do so.

### Benefits
* **Efficiency:** The bank currently doesn't have an banking application and would benefit greatly from this as users and tellers can now easily see what their bank balance is. 
* **Clarity:** The application will display clearly what was credited into the account and how much money and when it was credited/deposited.
* **Ease:** Users can easily deposit or withdraw money from their bank account with the new application.
* **Keeps a record:** The bank now has a was of keeping a record of their customer's transactions and knows how much balance each of their customer's accounts have.

### Risks
* **No feedback:** Customers can't interact with the application and thus would need to have the teller conduct the transactions.
* **Unable to make edits:** If the user enters an incorrect amount or mistyped a number, they can't change the transaction.
